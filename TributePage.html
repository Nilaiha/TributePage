                                A strawberry is not a berry in a botanical
                                sense, because berries have their seeds on the
                                inside
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In a way, the strawberry is a false fruit,
                                because the actual fruits are the many tiny
                                "seeds" on the outside of the strawberry
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Therefore, the average strawberry has 200 seeds
                            </li>
                            <li>The strawberry is part of the rose family</li>

                                Eight strawberries have more Vitamin C than an

                                The ancient Romans used strawberries to treat
                                fever, sore throat and even depression

                                The world record for the heaviest strawberries
                                is 250 grams - it had a circumference of nearly
                                30 cm and was grown in Japan

                                In Belgium, there is a museum dedicated entirely

                                Strawberries are typically the first fruit to
